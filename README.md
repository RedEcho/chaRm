# chaRm

chaRm is a Rainmeter skin that aims to be as plug and play as possible. It essentially adds some basic info as widgets on your desktop. 
More info about Rainmeter on their [website](https://www.rainmeter.net/) or the [GitHub of the project](https://github.com/rainmeter/rainmeter).

## What is chaRm?

chaRm scales to low resolutions pretty well.

It also changes colors to suit th chosen wallpaper, thanks to the [chameleon 3rd party plugin](https://github.com/socks-the-fox/Chameleon)

## Why?

My work on chaRm started after a few colleagues and friends showed interrest in my old rainmeter skin. It was a PITA to adapt my skin to each of their individaul setups, so I set out to create a skin that would adapt itself.
As for the name, this skin is both CHARMing and a CHAMeleon. And yes, at the beginning, I thought it was very clever.

## Current limitations

- chaRm is only tested on 4:3 up to 16:9 aspect ratio, and on 800x600 up to 1920x1080 resolution screens. I'm not equiped to test 21:9, 1440p or4K
- The support for bright wallpapers is still minimal, some will make the skin quite hard to read. I'm working on it! (dark wallpapers should look ok in most cases)

## Instructions

First install the [chameleon plugin](https://software.socksthefox.net/chameleon/), then [install chaRm just as any Rainmeter skin](https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/installing-skins/)
Refresh All, as well as the layout file, choose your wallpaper, and you're set. I recommand to choose a neutral colour for your Windows.
